# Network

There are two basic types of networks:

* Infrastructure mode,
* Ad hoc mode.

## Infrastructure mode

This environment is mainly used for homes, small office or home office and uses the access point to communicate with the wireless device. The access point and clients must be configured to use the same network name. The access point is wired to a router or switch to give customers access to the internet, printers or some peripheral devices.
