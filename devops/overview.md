# Overview

DevOps boosts culture of collaboration between software development \(Dev\) and operations \(Ops\) teams. Emphasises a shift in mindset that leads to increased productivity through automation, security, continuous delivery. 

It enables teams to self service, focusing on planning, developing, measuring and improving what matters.

‘four key metrics’ \(described in [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM)\) track performance of DevOps implementation in the organisations.  
  
   Lead Time for Changes - How long it takes to run \(code\) changes in production.  
   Deployment Frequency - How often \(code\) changes are deployed to production.  
   Time to Restore Service - How long it takes to restore failed service.  
   Change Failure Rate - What is the percentage of failed deployments.

DevOps transforms business and brings benefits like innovation, shorter time to market, user satisfaction, growth.
